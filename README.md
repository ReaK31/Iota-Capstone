# Healthcare Access and Hospitalization Risk Prediction

## üìå Overview

This project investigates the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH)‚Äîincluding geographic access to healthcare, poverty, insurance coverage, and environmental indicators‚Äîon estimated hospitalization risk at the U.S. census tract level.

Using publicly available datasets from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and HealthData.gov, we:

* Construct an engineered risk score to estimate hospitalization vulnerability.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in SDOH indicators.
* Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict risk at the census tract level.


## üéØ Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw SDOH and COVID hospital capacity datasets.
* Integrate data sources across varying geographic levels (tract and hospital).
* Engineer a composite hospitalization risk score using key socioeconomic and geographic indicators.
* Test hypotheses around healthcare access disparities and their relationship to hospitalization.
* Build and evaluate regression-based predictive models.
* Visualize hospitalization risk and feature importance at the national level.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

* Data Cleaning
Standardized and imputed missing values for demographic and hospital data.

* Feature Engineering
Created a hospitalization risk score using weighted metrics such as poverty rate, access to care, insurance coverage, and population vulnerability.

* Data Integration
Linked census tracts to nearby hospitals via geospatial methods for richer context.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovered regional patterns and trends using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

* Hypothesis Testing
Conducted statistical tests to assess the relationship between access to healthcare and hospitalization metrics.

* Modeling
Implemented regression-based models (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost) to predict hospitalization risk based on SDOH features.

* Visualization
Developed heatmaps, choropleth maps, and feature importance plots to communicate findings.

## Key Features Used

* Geographic Access: Distance to nearest emergency department and health clinics
* Socioeconomic: Poverty rate, uninsured rate, Medicaid/private insurance coverage
* Demographics: Percent elderly population, disability rate
*Environmental: PM2.5 air pollution exposure

## Tools & Technologies

* Python - Data processing, modeling, visualization (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost)
* R - Data wrangling, statistical analysis, and plotting (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2)
* SQL - Querying and managing structured datasets (MSSSQL)
* Jupyter Notebooks - Prototyping and documenting analysis
* GitHub - Version control and team collaboration
