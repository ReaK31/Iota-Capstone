# Final EDA Visualizations

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains the **final set of EDA visualizations and scripts** that contributed to the final report for the capstone project.

## Contents

- 'figures/':  
  Contains polished PNG images of key plots and charts used in the final report.

- 'EDA_Statistics_and_Visuals.ipynb':  
  Jupyter notebook with final EDA code and visuals.

- 'Choropleth_map_and_box_plot.py':  
  Python script for generating the choropleth map and box plot included in the report.

## 🛠️ Running the Code

- Built and tested in **Google Colab.**
- To run locally in Jupyter Notebook:
  - Add 'print()' for outputs that don't auto-display.
  - Install 'rpy2' for R code support:
    '''bash
    pip install rpy2
    '''
- R package installations are handled inside the notebook via 'install.packages()' in the '%%R' cells.
